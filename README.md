# Open Terms Archive - PGA services

These services declarations are maintained by the [Platform Governance Archive](https://pga.hiig.de/) at the Universität Bremen's [Center for Media Communication and Information Research (ZeMKI)](https://www.uni-bremen.de/zemki) and tracked on [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org).

The terms listed in this collection are tracked by the [Open Terms Archive engine](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine).

You can [explore the tracked versions](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions) interactively or [download them as a dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/releases) in the `OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions` repository.

## Suggested engine updates

In order to keep the Open Terms Archive engine up-to-date, updates will be automatically suggested by [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) in a pull request when a new version is available.

While engine updates follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) standard and automated collection tests should provide a safety net, it is ultimately the responsibility of the maintainers of the collection to check version compatibility and potentially adjust the declarations before applying these updates.
